          <h4>Why is this study being done?</h4>
        </div>

        <p>
        As of this time, it is not that easy to find high protection masks for
        some people.

        Protection is a combination of high filtration efficiency and fit.
        Lots of work has been done on vetting the filtration efficiency side. However,
        without a good fitting mask, the efficacy of high filtration masks can
        be severely diminished.

        To find masks that fit well, there is still a bunch of trial and error
        involved. We want to make the search for masks that do both (high
        filtration efficiency and good fit) simpler and easier. For more
        details, please see the <a
        href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XZ2foY_cpDYImOBE5P048byj1jqLZ5JHdif6rfx3HAU/edit#heading=h.akrinhrxttzu">Respirator

        In terms of adding data to the system, it can vary, depending on
        whether or not you have access to qualitative fit testing (QLFT) or
        quantitative fit testing (QNFT) devices.

          <h4>What are the study procedures?</h4>
        </div>


        <h5>Phase 1: manual measurements of facial features (using caliper/tape) </h5>

        <p>
        You will be asked to give information about demographics and facial measurements <router-link :to='{name: "RespiratorUsers"}'>here</router-link>.
        Once that is filled out, you can add the following fit testing data <router-link :to='{name: "NewFitTest"}'> here</router-link>:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>user seal check</li>
          <li>qualitative fit testing</li>
          <li>quantitative fit testing</li>
          <li>comfort</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        You will be guided by the UI. Clicking on the "Save and Continue" button will validate the information being saved and will show helpful error messages and general messages. For example, if a user fails the user seal check section, they don't need to add qualitative or quantitative fit testing data (as it is assumed that they will most likely fail either of those more stringent tests).
        </p>

        <h5>Phase 2: automated inference of facial measurements via selfies </h5>

        <p>Getting facial measurements via caliper and tape can be a bit tedious and could deter adoption of said recommender system. Breathesafe LLC will attempt to simplify this process by inferring facial measurements via selfies. You will be given the opportunity to share selfies to this project to assess and improve the performance of a facial measurement system based on selfies. Given your facial measurements that were taken from phase 1 using caliper and tape, we will assess and improve the accuracy of said inference system.
        </p>

          <br>
          <h4>Can participants choose to leave the study?</h4>
        </div>
        <p>Participants may be able to delete their data anytime using this button (TODO). That will delete user information such as email, password, demographics, and fit testing data.
          Deletion of data, however, will have no effect on aggregated results for published research.
        </p>

        <div id='risks-harms'>

          <br>
          <h4>What are the risks and harms of participating in the study?</h4>
        </div>
        <p>Sensitive data like facial measurements will be stored in a database.
        Data such as the following will be collected:
        <ul>
          <li>first name</li>
          <li>last name</li>
          <li>email</li>
          <li>facial measurement data - to create a recommendation system tailored to the individual.</li>
          <li>selfies - to validate facial measurement inference from photos.</li>
          <li>fit testing measurement tools used (e.g. PortaCount)</li>
          <li>fit testing results (e.g. pass/fail for Qualitative Fit Testing, fit factors for Quantitative Fit Testing)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

          <br>
          <h4>What are the benefits of participating in this study?</h4>
        </div>

        <p>One direct benefit is one might be able to find a mask that has overall high protection (combination of fit and high filtration efficiency), if they haven't aready. Another benefit is gaining a sense of accomplishment in helping others find masks that offer high protection for their faces by providing data that will be used to improve performance of a personalized recommender system.</p>

          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>How will participants' information be kept confidential?</h4>
        </div>

        <p> In terms
        of data publicly displayed on this web app, we will only show
        aggregate data about users, such as demographic information and fit
        test results for each mask. We will maintain privacy of individual fit
        testing information along with demographics. We will preserve privacy
        of individuals in the aggregation of the data: if a demographic has
        less than 5 people in it, they will be grouped in the "Prefer not to
        disclose / too small sample size" group.
        </p>

        <p>This study may go on indefinitely. If for any reason you want your data deleted, you may do so. See
<router-link :to="tocPath('leave-study')"> Can participants choose to leave the study?</router-link>
        section above for details.</p>

        Breathesafe LLC will follow best security practices to prevent malicious actors from accessing said database. Example of such actions are:
        <ul>
          <li>using https to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.</li>
          <li>admins will be using password managers and two factor authentication</li>
          <li>number of admins will be as small as possible to limit risk</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Users could also choose to be anonymous when signing up. They are
        free to use fake names to decrease the risk of their biometric data
        identifying them in the small but non-zero chance that a hacker gets a
        hold of the database.</p>
