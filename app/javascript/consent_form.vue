          <h4>Why is this study being done?</h4>
        </div>

        <p>
        As of this time, it is not that easy to find high protection masks for
        some people.

        Protection is a combination of high filtration efficiency and fit.
        Lots of work has been done on vetting the filtration efficiency side. However,
        without a good fitting mask, the efficacy of high filtration masks can
        be severely diminished.

        To find masks that fit well, there is still a bunch of trial and error
        involved. We want to make the search for masks that do both (high
        filtration efficiency and good fit) simpler and easier. For more
        details, please see the <a

          <h4>What are the study procedures?</h4>
        </div>


        <h5>Phase 1: manual measurements of facial features (using caliper/tape) </h5>

        <p>
        You will be asked to give information about demographics and facial measurements <router-link :to='{name: "RespiratorUsers"}'>here</router-link>.
        Once that is filled out, you can add the following fit testing data <router-link :to='{name: "NewFitTest"}'> here</router-link>:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>user seal check</li>
          <li>qualitative fit testing (if applicable)</li>
          <li>quantitative fit testing (if applicable)</li>
          <li>comfort</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        You will be guided by the UI. Clicking on the "Save and Continue" button will validate the information being saved and will show helpful error messages and general messages. For example, if a user fails the user seal check section, they don't need to add qualitative or quantitative fit testing data (as it is assumed that they will most likely fail either of those more stringent tests).
        </p>

        <h5>Phase 2: automated inference of facial measurements via selfies </h5>

        <p>Getting facial measurements via caliper and tape can be a bit tedious and could deter adoption of said recommender system. Breathesafe LLC will attempt to simplify this process by inferring facial measurements via selfies. You will be given the opportunity to share selfies to this project to assess and improve the performance of a facial measurement system based on selfies. Given your facial measurements that were taken from phase 1 using caliper and tape, we will assess and improve the accuracy of said inference system.

        to, click "Edit" and then click "Delete." This functionality is
        available for people who have gone through the registration process.
        That will delete user information such as email, password,
        demographics, and fit testing data. Users will have the ability to
        delete their data and have their data not contribute to research until
        publication (which is TBD). Deletion of data in the future will have no
        effect to the state of previously published research, but may alter
        existing statistical machine learning models that are being used at the
        time on the web application.

        <p>Sensitive data like facial measurements will be stored in a database.
        Data such as the following will be collected:
        <ul>
          <li>first name</li>
          <li>last name</li>
          <li>email</li>

          <li>facial measurement data - to create a recommendation system tailored to the individual.</li>

        <p>One direct benefit is one might be able to find a mask that has overall high protection (combination of fit and high filtration efficiency), if they haven't aready. Another benefit is gaining a sense of accomplishment in helping others find masks that offer high protection for their faces by providing data that will be used to improve performance of a personalized recommender system.</p>

        aggregate data about users, such as demographic information and fit
        test results for each mask. We will maintain privacy of individual fit
        testing information along with demographics. We will preserve privacy
        of individuals in the aggregation of the data: if a demographic has
        less than 5 people in it, they will be grouped in the "Prefer not to
        disclose / too small sample size" group.
